                <h3>Crispy Chicken's Thighs (aka. Maria's Chicken)</h3>
                <p>In my family, this dish is called Maria’s Chicken. No one knows exactly where the name comes from but it has been a staple dinner recipe passed down for three generations and counting. These 5 ingredient, juicy, uber crispy chicken thighs are easy to whip up every day of the week for an excellent entrée that pairs well with almost any side dish. They are a healthier and easier alternative to fried chicken but will taste just as good and be just as crispy. Do not skip the marination process as marinating the chicken thighs in lemon juice helps tenderize the meat and keeps the thighs juicy after cooking. For proper results use bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, no substitutions.</p>

                <h3>Monster Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
                <p>Are you ever in the mood to just eat a cookie the size of your face? Just me? Well, if you have an insatiable sweet tooth, this is the recipe for you. These monster chocolate chip cookies are warm and ooey-gooey on the inside, and perfectly golden on top. I highly recommend stress baking these when you have a test in the morning (I may or may not know from experience).</p>

                <h3>Chewy Brownies</h3>
                <p>Boxed brownies are a staple of every household kitchen, providing warm chocolatey goodness in just a few simple steps. It’s hard to beat the classic, but brownies don’t have to be complicated to be better. Using a pot, a spatula, and a bowl you can get the best brownies you’ve ever had without much of a fuss. You can also double this recipe if you want to make enough to impress your friends or bribe a teacher for that A you need.</p>

                <h3>Pickled Red Onions</h3>
                <p>For many fortunate Americans, the COVID-19 lockdown provided ample opportunity for culinary experimentation. Some chose to spend their time cultivating a sourdough starter and improving their bread skills, evident in the flour shortages starting in late March 2020 and lasting until early April… My experiment of choice was pickling, and of all the pickled vegetables I made —which was objectively too many — my favorites were pickled red onions. I’m not a huge fan of eating raw onions because they can be a bit too harsh flavor-wise, but the pickling process cuts through some of that sharpness and gives the onions bright, fresh acidity. Once pickled, red onions perfectly complement anything from tacos or salads to avocado toast.</p>
